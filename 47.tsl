question("What is the conductivity of a semiconductor sample having electron concentration of {Q}x10^{18}m^{-3}, hole concentration of {S}x10^{19}m^{-3}, electron mobility of {U}m^{2}V^{-1}S^{-1} and hole mobility of {V}m^{2}V^{-1}S^{-1}. (Take charge of electron as 1.6 x 10^{-19} C)")



Q = select(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)
S = select(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) 
U = select(0.9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
V = select(0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.04, 0.05, 0.06)


P = 1.6 * ((Q*U) + (S*V))
