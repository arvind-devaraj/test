question("The ratio of maximum acceleration to maximum velocity in a simple harmonic motion is {Q}s^{-1}. At, t=0 the displacement is {R}m. What is the maximum acceleration? The initial phase is {S}.")

Q = select(2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)

R  = select(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)

S = select(90, 60, 45, 30)

P =  Q*2*(R/sin(S*3.14/180))

<< {P} m/s^(2) >>
