question("There is a uniform electrostatic field in a region. The potential at various points on a small sphere centred at P, in the region, is found to vary between the limits {Q} to {R} . What is the potential at a point on the sphere whose radius vector makes an angle of {S} with the direction of the field.")

Q = select(589, 590, 591, 592)
T = select(0.1, 0.2 ,0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9)

R = Q+T

P = (R-Q) * cos(S*3.14/180)
