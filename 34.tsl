<<Dopplerâ€™s Effect for source and observer moving in opposite directions is given by, f1 = f((v+v0)/(v-vs))>>
concept("11935,11918")
<<where f1 is the frequency observed by observer and f is the frequency given by source {L}. v0 is observed s speed ={K} m/s and vs is the source velocity ={K} m/s>>
<<Hence f1= (330+{K})/(330-{K}) x {L}>>
F= (330 + K) * L/(330 - K)

<< {F} Hz >>
