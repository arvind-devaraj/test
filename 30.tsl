<<A telephonic communication service is working at carrier frequency of {K} GHz. Only {L}% of it is utilize for transmission. How many telephonic channels can be transmitted simultaneously if each channel requires a bandwidth of {M} KHz>>
<<10% of 10GHz = n x 5 kHz, where n is number of channels >>

<< number of channels is {(L/100)*(K*10e9)/M*10e3} \n>>
