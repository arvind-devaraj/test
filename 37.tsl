<<An automobile travelling at {K} Km/h, can be stopped at a distance of (L) m by applying brakes. If the same automobile is travelling at {M} Km/h, the stopping distance in meters, is (Assume no skidding)>>
<<The stopping distance of an object moving with a speed vand slowing down with a constant retardation a is given by: S = u^2/2a>>
concept("9614")
<<Hence for the same value of acceleration it can be said that :  S is directly proportional to u^2>>
<<In the Given situation, the speed v is {K}Km/h and itâ€™s stopping distance is {L} m . We want to find out how much is the stopping distance if the speed is {M}Km/h. We can do so using the above proportionality relationship: S1/S2 = (u1)^2/(u2)^2>>
<<Substituting the values, we get the following answer, {(M/K)**2 * L }m >>
